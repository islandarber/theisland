        Amorgos is the easternmost island of the Cyclades island group and the
        nearest island to the neighboring Dodecanese island group in Greece.
        <br />
        Along with 16 neighboring islets, the largest of which (by land area) is
        Nikouria Island,<br />
        it comprises the municipality of Amorgos, which has a land area of
        126.346 square kilometres (48.782 square miles) and a population of
        1,973 (2011 census). <br />
        Throughout history, Amorgos was also known as Yperia, or Platagy,
        Pagali, Psichia, and Karkisia.[2] Amorgos features many remnants of
        ancient civilizations. At the time of Archaic Greece, there were three
        independent city-states there. <br />
        They are believed to have featured autonomous constitutions but the same
        currency. <br />
        Amorgos is distinguished by the size and quality of the walls
        surrounding the city of Arkesini, the ancient towers whose remains are
        scattered around the island, ancient tombs, stone tools, inscriptions,
        vases and by other antiquities.
        <br />
        Due to the name Minoa, it is suspected that Amorgos had been colonized
        by the Cretans from ancient times, but there is no archeological
        evidence supporting this view. <br />
        The island was visited by the British explorers Theodore and Mabel Bent
        in 1883/4.

      <h2>The beaches</h2>

      <p>
        The beaches on Amorgos Island stand out for their deep, crystal-clear
        waters and the wild landscape that surrounds them. <br />
        As the island keeps its authentic character, most of them are pristine.
        <br />However, a few partly-organized beaches are available for families
        and anyone wanting to have access to basic facilities. <br />

        In brief, most of Amorgos' beaches are non-organized. Agia Anna is
        renowned <br />because of the filming of the movie The Deep Blue. Agios
        Pavlos and Mouros are also among the favorites of visitors. Aegiali
        Beach is the most visited <br />organized beach. Nudism is a common
        phenomenon on remote beaches.
